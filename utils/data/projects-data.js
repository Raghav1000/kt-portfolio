      "We created a demo project called 'Tile Viewer' in which the business model required a website showcasing 3D models of various rooms in a house, such as the living room, bedroom, kitchen, and bathroom. Our task was to replace the 3D model tiles with the provided tile images The demo was well capable enough to change the tiles, add pattern using two tiles, add grouting to tiles, changing the sizes of the tile. To achieve this, we substituted the 3D model tiles and floor meshes with the tile image by creating a texture of the image and evenly repeating it across the mesh. For tasks like adding grout, scaling, and implementing patterns, we had to write OpenGL code.",
